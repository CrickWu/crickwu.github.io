title: About

This is just a simple blog where I write summaries about what I have read recently, either technical stuff or random chats. The construction is still under go.

My research interests include machine learning with specific emphasis on Graph Learning and Natural Language Processing, particularly in the training and inference of large language models.

I currently work at Google. I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Language Technologies Institute at Carnegie Mellon University in August 2020, under the guidance of Professor [Yiming Yang](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./yiming/). I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from [Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences](http://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en) (Yao Class) at Tsinghua University, where I worked with Prof. [Jianyang Zeng](http://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~compbio/index.html).
